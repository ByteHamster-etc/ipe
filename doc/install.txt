            Building and installing Ipe on Unix
--------------------------------------------------------------------


****  For MAC OS X, see the separate document "macos.txt"! ****


Quickstart for Linux
--------------------

If you have a recent Mint, Ubuntu, or Debian system, the following
steps will install the necessary libraries and tools:

    sudo apt-get install build-essentials checkinstall
    sudo apt-get install qt6-base-dev qt6-base-dev-tools
    sudo apt-get install libqt6svg6
    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libcairo2-dev libjpeg8-dev
    sudo apt-get install libpng-dev liblua5.4-dev zlib1g-dev
    sudo apt-get install libspiro-dev libgsl-dev curl doxygen

Now you can compile and install Ipe into /usr/local:
(Note that 7.x.y has to be replaced by the current Ipe version!)

    cd src
    make IPEPREFIX=/usr/local
    sudo checkinstall --pkgname=ipe --pkgversion=7.x.y --backup=no \
    	 --fstrans=no --default make install IPEPREFIX=/usr/local
    sudo ldconfig

The line with "checkinstall" makes sure that Ipe is installed as
package "ipe".  If you no longer need Ipe, or to remove it before
compiling the next release, you can completely remove it from your
system by saying

    sudo apt-get remove ipe

If something doesn't work for you, please read below to check the
details!

Detailed instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Required components
-------------------

Before you can compile Ipe, you will need to have the following tools
and libraries:

 * GNU make

   The Ipe makefiles are written for GNU make.  A Linux system will
   already have it.  On other Unix systems, GNU make is often
   installed as 'gmake'.  Otherwise, install it yourself from
   www.gnu.org. Other "make" implementations will not work!

 * The compression library 'zlib'

   Very likely you already have it on your system (check for the
   include file "zlib.h").  If not, obtain it from "www.gzip.org/zlib"
   and install it.

 * The font library 'Freetype 2'

   On Linux, you most likely already have this on your system.  You
   will need the development package (on Debian/Ubuntu, this is
   "libfreetype6-dev").  

   The original sources are at "www.freetype.org".  You need version
   2.1.8 or newer.

 * The Cairo library (version 1.8.0 or higher)

   The Gnome desktop uses this high-quality rendering library, so you
   may already have it.  You will need the development package,
   e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu "libcairo2-dev".  

   You can also install from sources at "www.cairographics.org".  If
   you compile Cairo yourself, note that you only need the image,
   Postscript, and svg surfaces (backends).  You also need freetype
   support, but no fontconfig.  Since Ipe does not need any
   platform-dependent backends, Cairo should compile fine on any
   platform.

 * The libpng library

   You'll need the development package, e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu
   "libpng-dev". You can also install from source at
   "http://www.libpng.org".

 * The libjpeg library (version 6 or higher)

   You'll need the development package, e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu
   "libjpeg-dev".  You can also use libjpeg-turbo instead (the
   package "libjpeg-turbo8-dev"), from "http://libjpeg-turbo.virtualgl.org/".

 * The Lua language (version 5.3 or 5.4)

   Lua is an embeddable scripting language. On Debian/Ubuntu, install
   "liblua5.4-dev".  Or compile from source at "www.lua.org" - the
   sources are ANSI C and compile very easily.  Ipe requires Lua 5.3
   or 5.4.

   Make sure that you build a DYNAMIC library.  Ipe will not work if
   Lua is linked statically (linking statically would include three
   copies of the Lua interpreter, resulting in random crashes).

 * The Qt 6 toolkit

   On Linux, you most likely already have it. On Debian/Ubuntu, you
   would need the packages "qt6-base-dev", "qt6-base-dev-tools",
   and "libqt6svg6" (the latter is the SVG plugin needed to display
   the icons).

   You can also download binaries or sources at "www.qt.io/".  You
   only need the Qt6Core, Qt6Gui, and Qt6Widgets libraries.

 * The GNU Scientific Library

   This library is used to improve the precision of intersections of
   Bezier splines and elliptic arcs.

   You'll need the development package, e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu
   "libgsl-dev". You can also install from source at
   "https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/".

 * The spiro library

   Spiro is a library for creating clothoid splines.

   You'll need the development package, e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu
   "libspiro-dev".  You can also install from source at
   "https://github.com/fontforge/libspiro".

 * Pdflatex, Xelatex, Lualatex
 
   Ipe needs a PDF-producing version of Latex to convert Latex source
   code to Postscript/PDF.  Ipe can do so through an online
   Latex-compilation service, or using a TeX installation on your
   computer.  You don't need to install LaTeX to compile and try out
   Ipe.

 * The curl program

   To use the online Latex-compilation, Ipe calls the "curl"
   program. (If you have a local Latex installation, it is not
   needed.)
   
   Most likely you already have "curl".  On Debian/Ubuntu, install the
   "curl" package.  You can also install from source at
   "https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/".



Configuring and building Ipe
----------------------------

There are some pieces of information you need to provide to the Ipe
build process by editing "src/config.mak" (in many cases you can also
just give the definitions on the make command line, see below).

You first have to indicate the location of the required components
listed above.  On Linux, you probably have a correctly working
'pkg-config' script, and the default settings should work.  

You'll have to check that the Lua package name is correct - try saying

     pkg-config --modversion lua5.4

If the package isn't found, try 'lua5.3', 'lua' or 'lua53', etc.

Second, you have to define the Ipe directory structure.  Normally, you
would only need to define IPEPREFIX properly, depending on where you
want Ipe to be installed.

These steps will then build Ipe:

     cd src
     make
     make install

Instead of editing "src/config.mak", you can also set the variables in
the make call, e.g.:

    cd src
    make IPEPREFIX=/usr/local
    sudo make install IPEPREFIX=/usr/local

You may need to do "make install" as root (depending on whether you
have write permission to the installation location).


Dynamic linking
---------------

The Ipe libraries are shared libraries, and so your dynamic linker has
to find "libipe*.so".  If you have chosen a standard library directory
for IPELIBDIR, saying "sudo ldconfig" will be enough to run Ipe.

If you installed in a different location, such as "/opt/ipe7", you
can make a small script called "ipe" like the following, and put it in
your path:

#!/bin/sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/ipe7/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
/opt/ipe7/bin/ipe $* &

Alternatively, you could put links to the library in a standard
location:

    sudo ln -f -s IPELIBDIR/lib* /usr/lib
    sudo ldconfig
