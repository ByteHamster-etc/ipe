            Building Ipe on Mac OS X
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe runs on Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite) and higher.


If you have homebrew or macports...
-----------------------------------

... then you can install the libraries that Ipe depends on simply by
saying:

  (for homebrew)
  sudo brew install libpng lua cairo freetype gsl libspiro

  (for macports)
  sudo port install libpng lua cairo freetype gsl libspiro

Then continue below under "Now you can compile Ipe".


--------------------------------------------------------------------
Detailed instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Install Xcode from the Mac App store:
 
   http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835

 * Agree to the Xcode license by saying this in a terminal:

     sudo xcodebuild -license

 * Install the command line tools by saying the following in a
   terminal:

     xcode-select --install

 * You need to start Xcode at least once to install some additional
   components. Close it when it's done installing.

 * Get libpng, Freetype, and Cairo

   If you don't want to install these through macports or homebrew,
   you can install the three libraries from sources.
   
   + The libpng library 

     Install from source at "http://www.libpng.org".

   + The font library 'Freetype 2'

     Install from source at "www.freetype.org".  

   + The Cairo library

     The sources are at "www.cairographics.org".  Compile with
     Freetype support, but without fontconfig.  You need the Quartz
     and PS backend (they are enabled by default), all others are
     optional (disable the X11 backends to create a smaller library).

 * The Lua language (version 5.3 or 5.4)

   Lua is an embeddable scripting language. Ipe requires Lua 5.3 or 5.4.

   Download the prebuild binaries from 
      http://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html

   You need the "lua-5.3_MacOS1010_lib.tar.gz" package only.  

   Unzip the package.
   
   Copy the header files ("lua.h" and other ".h" files) into
      "IPEDEPS/include" 
   Copy "liblua53.dylib" into "IPEDEPS/lib".
   (Where IPEDEPS is as you set it in the previous step.)
   
   Or use "/usr/local/include" and "/usr/local/lib", and set
   LUA_CFLAGS and LUA_LIBS appropriately in "src/macos.mak".
   
   DO NOT install "liblua53.a" on your system, to avoid accidentally
   performing a static link.

   Alternatively, compile from source at "www.lua.org" - the sources
   are ANSI C and compile very easily.  Make sure that you build a
   DYNAMIC (shared) library.  Unfortunately, "make macosx" compiles a
   static library - but you really MUST compile a shared library, so
   you need to modify the Makefile!

   Ipe will not work if Lua is linked statically (linking statically
   would include three copies of the Lua interpreter, resulting in
   random crashes).

 * The GNU Scientific Library

   This library is used to improve the precision of intersections
   of Bezier splines and elliptic arcs.

   You can find GSL at "https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/".  It
   compiles cleanly on MacOS using 'configure' and 'make'.

   You can use either the static or the shared library version of
   libgsl.

 * The spiro library

   Spiro is a library for creating clothoid splines.

   Get the sources from "https://github.com/fontforge/libspiro".

   You can use either the static or the shared library version of
   libspiro.

 * Pdflatex, Xelatex, Lualatex
 
   Ipe needs a PDF-producing version of Latex to convert Latex source
   code to Postscript/PDF.  Ipe can do so through an online
   Latex-compilation service, or using a TeX installation on your
   computer.  You don't need to install LaTeX to compile and try out
   Ipe.  If you decide to install LaTeX later, most people seem to use
   MacTeX (https://www.tug.org/mactex/).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

 * The Makefile assumes that pkg-config is available and can determine
   the compilation flags and libraries for the dependencies.

   If this is not the case, you'll need to edit 'src/macos.mak' and
   fill in the correct values. (You may prefer to start with
   'macos-manual.mak'.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Now you can compile Ipe:

     cd src
     make
     make app

 * Ipe is now available as a MacOS app in "build/Ipe.app".

   You can start it from the command line by saying

     open ../build/Ipe.app

   (assuming you are still in the "src" directory).

   Or double-click on the Ipe.app icon in the Finder.
   
   You can now use the Finder to move the "Ipe.app" bundle to
   /Applications, or anywhere else.

   Note that "Ipe.app" is linked dynamically against the libraries
   liblua, libpng, Freetype, Cairo, libgsl, and libspiro.  It will not
   work if you copy the bundle to a different computer that does not
   have (compatible versions of) the libraries in the same locations.
   If you used homebrew or macports to install the libraries, make
   sure you don't accidentally remove those packages.

 * You will want to add the "/Applications/Ipe.app/Contents/MacOS"
   directory to your path, so that you can start Ipe and use the tools
   ipetoipe, iperender, etc. from the command line.

 * If you use a local LaTeX installation, then the 'pdflatex',
   'xelatex', and 'lualatex' program must be in one of these
   locations:

     * /Library/TeX/texbin
     * /usr/texbin
     * /usr/local/texbin
     * /usr/local/bin
     * /opt/local/bin

   If your pdflatex is somewhere else, change the PATH being searched
   in "Ipe.app/Contents/Info.plist".
